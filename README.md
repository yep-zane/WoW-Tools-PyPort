# WoW-Tools-PyPort 
This version is formally know as version 5. This is a python port of the previous version of WoW-Tools

This version uses Python for the front-end to create some nicer looking terminals to interact with. The backend is still powered by batch scripts just to ensure no problems with permission issues. Due to this being created with Python you will need a version of Python run time, which can be obtained at https://www.python.org/downloads/ . WoWTools is designed to manage AC-Repack World of Warcraft Wrath of the Lich King servers!
